Description: Tidy, analyze, and plot directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). 'ggdag' is 
    built on top of 'dagitty', an R package that uses the 'DAGitty' web tool 
    (<http://dagitty.net>) for creating and analyzing DAGs. 'ggdag' makes it 
    easy to tidy and plot 'dagitty' objects using 'ggplot2' and 'ggraph', as 
    well as common analytic and graphical functions, such as determining 
    adjustment sets and node relationships. 
Depends: 
    R (>= 3.0.0),
